# DevConnect

## Description

DevConnect is an application that allows for developers to connect with each other. The app features OAuth authentication through a LinkedIn token. Once authenticated, the user is allowed access to the apps restricted features. DevConnect allows for the user to search for a developer using an API call to render information about the developer. This information can be saved to the database, or the user can update their information manually. The site allows prospective clients to post job ads with specific qualifications. The application allows for web developers to highlight their skills and connect with other developers to share knowledge and collaborate with one another.
